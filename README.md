# Statistical Learning: Final Project

This is our final project for the class "Statistical Learning" in the Winter Term 25/26.
We trained a neural network and a lasso regression to predict the FIFA potential scores for a large dataset of football players based on their age, physical and cognitive abilities. 
Both models are tested, evaluated with MSE and MAE, and compared. 
Enjoy.
